## Problem Statement 
Engineering students in India are often required to work with sensors in their coursework, and being able
to collect and display sensor data can be a valuable skill. To help students develop this skill, a software
application needs to be built that can collect data from various sensors of a mobile device and display it in
a graphical user interface (GUI). The application should be able to run continuously without any
interruptions, ensuring that data is collected and displayed accurately.
The development of this application will require a solid understanding of software engineering principles
and expertise in developing user-friendly GUIs. The software needs to be designed in such a way that it
can handle the data from various sensors of a mobile device robustly and efficiently. This can be
achieved by adopting best practices such as data compression and efficient data structures, ensuring that
the application can handle the large amounts of sensor data that may be generated.
Furthermore, the software application should be designed with usability in mind, as it will be used by
engineering students who may not have extensive experience in software development. The user
interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and visual cues to help guide the
user. Overall, the development of this application will be a valuable learning experience for engineering
students in India, helping them to develop skills that are highly relevant in today&#39;s technology-driven
world.


## Title: Sensor Data Collection and Visualization App for Mobile Devices

**Description:** This project is aimed at collecting gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer data from a mobile device and syncing it to a Firebase database. The same data is streamed to the website in real-time. The collected data can be used for a wide range of applications such as motion tracking, activity recognition, and fitness monitoring.

The app is designed with software engineering principles in mind, ensuring that it can handle large amounts of sensor data efficiently by adopting best practices such as data compression and efficient data structures. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. The app is an excellent learning tool for engineering students in India, helping them to develop skills that are highly relevant in today's technology-driven world.


## Technology used:
* **Android Studio:** to develop the mobile application
* **Firebase Realtime Database:** to store the collected data
* **Java:** to write the code for the mobile application
* **JavaScript:** to write the code for the website
## Usage
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in Android Studio.
* Connect your mobile device to the computer and run the application.
* The application will start collecting gyroscope and accelerometer data from the mobile device.
* The collected data will be synced to a Firebase real-time database.
* The website will use Firebase's Realtime Database API to display the collected data.
* You can view the collected data in the Firebase console and on the website.
