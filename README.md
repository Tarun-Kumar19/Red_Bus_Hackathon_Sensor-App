#Problem Statement 
Engineering students in India are often required to work with sensors in their coursework, and being able
to collect and display sensor data can be a valuable skill. To help students develop this skill, a software
application needs to be built that can collect data from various sensors of a mobile device and display it in
a graphical user interface (GUI). The application should be able to run continuously without any
interruptions, ensuring that data is collected and displayed accurately.
The development of this application will require a solid understanding of software engineering principles
and expertise in developing user-friendly GUIs. The software needs to be designed in such a way that it
can handle the data from various sensors of a mobile device in a robust and efficient manner. This can be
achieved by adopting best practices such as data compression and efficient data structures, ensuring that
the application can handle the large amounts of sensor data that may be generated.
Furthermore, the software application should be designed with usability in mind, as it will be used by
engineering students who may not have extensive experience in software development. The user
interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and visual cues to help guide the
user. Overall, the development of this application will be a valuable learning experience for engineering
students in India, helping them to develop skills that are highly relevant in today&#39;s technology-driven
world.
